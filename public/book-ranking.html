<h3>The Midnight Library.</h3>
<P>If you were presented with endless possibilities of the life that you'd love to live, 
    which one would you choose?</P>

<h3>Local Woman Missing.</h3>
<p>It's a story about love, betrayal and 
    the lengths we're willing to go if our lives depended on it.</p>

<h3>As Long as The Lemon Trees Grow.</h3>
<p>I loved this book because of the perspective that the author chose to 
    narrate this story from. 
    <br>We get to see life from those who are oppressed and treated unjustly.
    <br>It's a story of Love, Heartbreak, Hope and Perseverance.
</p>

<h3>The Courage to be Disliked.</h3>
<p>I can't begin to explain how mind-boggling this book is, it's a must read.
    <br>I guarantee that after finishing this book 
    you won't have the same mindset that you'd had before starting it. 
</p>


<h3>The Four Agreements</h3>
<p>This is one of those books that reading them once isn't enough.</p>

<h3>Outliers.</h3>
<p>How Malcolm Gladwell managed to put these thoughts into words and into a format 
    where you won't need to go through pains in order to understand this text, is amazing. <br>
Truly Amazing.
